There are 3 main Python codes for this task. 

 1. tools.py
 2. runTask.py
 3. run.py

The user would only need to run 'run.py'. 

I have also included a 'requirements.txt' which contains all
the packages I used for this task. 

Simply type the following on the terminal to install them:

  pip install -r requirements.txt
