Instructions
============

We have been given a colleagues work and I don't like it.
Your task is to make the code more usable and add test(s) for it.

Specifically:

 * The README.txt should have instructions on how to use the script.
 * The script should be a (little) bit more flexible in how it is executed.
 * The script should have tests so I can immediately tell if it is working as expected.

The first thing you should do is make a git repository and add these files as your first commit.
You should apply your commit strategy to changes that you make.
I am expecting to see more than two commits.

It is quite possible that OpenCV will not work for you.
That is acceptable.
Write your tests with what you expect to get (something in the ballpark is fine) and if the test(s) fail then they fail, no issue there.
For example, if you expect to get 'five red balloons' as an answer I would be concerned but if you were expecting to get '[[0.3, 3.4, 2.5], ... ] I would consider that a ballpark answer.
I do not want you to correct the code so that it runs through to completion.
You can but your suitability for the role won't depend on it.

Zip up the work you do and email it back.
In your email please also add how much time you spent on the work.

It is also fine to do a small part really well and say in your email that you did this part well and stopped because of time but you would normally carry on and do the rest in this manner.
I am expecting that each of the above specific points are progressed to some degree.

Your email should contain a summary of what you did, and what you did not do, and why.

If you don't know **ask**.
I cannot stress this enough.

One last thing, whilst I encourage you to email any questions, if I were to reply with the first result from a google search.
I would consider that to be an unfavourable outcome.
If you don't now how to do something and ask, or if you want to know if what you have done is correct or on the right path and ask.
I would consider that to be a favourable outcome.

Enjoy,
Hugh.
